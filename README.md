## My process

The mobile layout was easy for me, but the desktop layout not even close, I wanted to make the cards move to different places as the window shrinks but it was extremely hard and I couldnÂ´t find any usefull information. I'm going to keep practicing on those types of layouts but this feels kinda like a bummer. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
